Hi Britt,

I'm trying to do a story today about the science behind rock salt vs. deicers. Do you know of a materials science professor (perhaps) or another expert who might be able to explain the differences and benefits/disadvantages of each?

Let me know if you think there might be a good person at Drexel.

Thanks!
